Computers are programmed to perform tasks
Different tasks = Different programs
Program:
-the instructions given to the computer
-sequence of basic operations executed in succession
-contains instruction sequences for all tasks it can execute

Sophisticated programs require teams of highly skilled programmers and other professionals
A computer program cannot develop the initiative to execute tasks in a better way than the programmers envisioned (Without Artificial Intelligence or something similar)
