Implementing Classes

Instance Variables
- store the data of an object
Instance of a Class
- an object of the class
The class declaration specifies the instance variables
An instance variable declaration consists of the following parts:
- access specifier
- type of variable 
- name of variable
Each object of a class has its own set of instance variables.
You should declare all instance variables as private.

#1 thing to remember: **ALWAYS MAKE DOCUMENTATION FOR EACH CLASS/METHOD/PARAMETER/RETURN VALUE**
