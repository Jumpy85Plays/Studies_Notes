Classes are the fundamental building blocks of Jaa progrmas:
- public class HelloPrinter (starts a new **class**)
Every source file can contain at most one public class
The name of the public class must match the name of the file containing the class.
(**Class** *HelloPrinter* must be contained in a HelloPrinter.java file)

Use "// to make comments"

**Difference between println and print in Java**
print will just use the same line while println will make a new line
