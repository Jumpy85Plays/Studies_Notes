## Algorithm
PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAM ANALYSIS
This chapter starts with the basic information regarding the fundamental knowledge required to solve various problems. Algorithm design is one of the primary steps in solving problems. Algorithms are set of steps or instructions required and designed to solve a specific problem.

Error : Before 
Defect: After 
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Developing good software is a tedious process which keeps on going i.e. under development for a long time before the software or the program takes the final shape. This process is often termed as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here, the output of one stage becomes the input of next stage.

Analyze the problem carefully -> Create Prototype and experiment until all requirements are finalized -> Design Algorithm -> Verify Algorithm -> Analyze Algorithm -> Code the Algorithm -> Test and Evaluate the Code -> Refine and repeat until software is complete -> Optimize the code for performance -> Maintain the application to meet client and user needs.

## Program Design

Program design is an important stage of software development. This phase takes the help of algorithms and different concepts of data structures to solve the problem(s) that is proposed.
