### Introduction to data structure
- data and information has significance
- different implementations take place to store it in different ways

**Data**
- a collection of facts and figures
- set of values
- values in a particular format

**Data Structure**
- a specific way of storing and organizing data
- data can be managed in different ways such as logical or mathematical models

**Data model factors**
1) loaded enough into the structure to reflect the actual relationship of the data with a real-world object
2) The formation should be so simple that one can efficiently process data whenever necessary

**Categories of structure**
- Linear Data Structure
- Non-Linear Data Structure

#### Linear Data Structure
- elements combine to form any specific order

**Linear Data Structure Techniques** 
- **Arrays**: provide a linear relationship between all elements represented using linear memory location
- **Linked List**: provide a linear relationship between all elements represented using the concept of pointers or links 

**Types of Linear Data Structure**
- Array 
- Queue
- Stack
- Link List

#### Non-Linear data structure
- represents data with a hierarchical relationship

**Types**
- Graph
- Family Trees
- Table of contents

**Tree**:
- Hierarchical relationship
**Graph**:
- relationship between pairs of elements


Source code is written into the compiler
saved as source files in human readable form
compiled and converted into machine code
creates a .exe file

**Characteristics of Data Types**
- chooses the set of values to which a constant will belong and assumed by a variable or an expression within a program or produced by an operator or a function
- the type of value indicated by a constant or a variable 
- Each operator or function expects some arguments of a fixed type represented by assigning a data type to those specific set of arguments and yields a result of a fixed type

**Data Types of Data Structures**
**Built-in data type**
	Predefined and has a fixed set of rules for declaration
	when belonging to a particular programming language, has built-in support
- Integer type
- Boolean type
- Character type
- Floating type

**Derived data type**
	can be implemented independently within a language
	are built combining both primary and built-in data types and then associating operations on them
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- List

**Basic Operations of Data Structures**
	Some specific operations process all data in the data structures
	The specific data structure has been chosen mostly depends on the number of times the occurrence of the operation which needs to be carried out on the data structure
- Traversing
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sorting
- Merging
